### 1. Gaussian FileParser('gaussian_fileparser.py') Python Program
This python program shows the optimization progress of a gaussian optimization calculations. The Variable ["Predicted change in Energy=", "Maximum Force", "RMS     Force", "Maximum Displacement", "RMS     Displacement"] are plotted again number of optimization cycles.
