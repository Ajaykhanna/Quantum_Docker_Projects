This python program shows the optimization progress of a gaussian optimization calculations. Variables plotted against the number of optimization cycles are:
| Patterns |
| ----------- |
| SCF Energy |
| Predicted change in Energy |
| Maximum Force |
| RMS     Force |
| Maximum Displacement |
| RMS     Displacement |
